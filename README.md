# Batch_Equator_Backup_and_Zip

### Explanation
---

This is a **Windows Batch Script** made in June 2020 for Stackpole International, Ancaster, ON. 

It is very time consuming to copy and past a large number of small files directly from computer to a USB drive. We have 5 Zeiss CMMs and 3 Renishaw Equators need weekly backup. This script was made to unitizing a portable version of 7Zip to zip all the files need to be backed up with one click. 



### Usage
---
1. Put the Bat Script inside the 7-ZipPortable folder
2. Change the directory in line 18 to the dirctory where to get the result files
3. Double click to run the bat file
4. The result folder will be zipped and saved with a timestamp, and then the result folder will be cleaned.
